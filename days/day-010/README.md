# day 10 gpu architecture

today is about what the gpu actually does when we render.

this is not about writing shaders yet.
it is about building intuition for performance and why webgl / three js is structured the way it is.

goal:
- cpu vs gpu responsibilities
- the rough rendering pipeline stages
- why draw calls are expensive
- why buffers/textures should be reused
