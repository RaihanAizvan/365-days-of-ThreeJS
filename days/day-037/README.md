# day 37 sphere geometries

today is about `SphereGeometry`.

spheres are common for planets, particles, lights, and UI knobs.
segment counts control smoothness and triangle count.

goal:
- understand `SphereGeometry` parameters
- choose segment counts wisely
- know when low vs high segments matter

## runnable demo

a demo exists in `days/day-037/demo`.

with vite:
- `npm run dev`
- open `/days/day-037/demo/index.html`
