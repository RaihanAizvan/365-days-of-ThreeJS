# day 36 box geometries

today is about `BoxGeometry`.

boxes seem simple, but they are extremely useful:
- blocks, buildings, crates
- bounding volumes
- proxy geometry

goal:
- understand `BoxGeometry` parameters
- understand segments (subdivisions)
- know when higher segments matter (deformations)

## runnable demo

a demo exists in `days/day-036/demo`.

with vite:
- `npm run dev`
- open `/days/day-036/demo/index.html`
