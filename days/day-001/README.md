# Day 001 — Math before Three.js

Today is just the basic math, not visuals.

Before touching Three.js, we need to understand the
mathematics that describes space, movement, and direction.

This day focuses on:
- Vectors as position and movement
- Direction using subtraction
- Why trigonometry exists in graphics

No rendering yet. Just foundations.

if you are a guy who hates maths i doubt will this works on you
