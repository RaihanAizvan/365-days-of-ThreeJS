# day 35 plane geometries

today is about flat geometries:
- `PlaneGeometry`
- `CircleGeometry`
- `RingGeometry`

these are useful for ground planes, UI panels, decals, and targets.

goal:
- know plane/circle/ring parameters
- understand orientation (planes face +Z by default)
- know how to rotate a plane to be a ground

## runnable demo

a demo exists in `days/day-035/demo`.

with vite:
- `npm run dev`
- open `/days/day-035/demo/index.html`
