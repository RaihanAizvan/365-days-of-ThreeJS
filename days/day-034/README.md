# day 34 primitive shapes

today is about **primitive shapes** in three.js.

three.js provides many built-in geometries.
understanding their parameters and use cases helps you prototype faster.

goal:
- know the common primitive geometries
- understand key parameters (segments, radius, etc)
- know when to use each shape

## runnable demo

a demo exists in `days/day-034/demo`.
