# day 42 visual feedback

today is about **visual feedback**.

feedback is how the scene communicates state to the user.
examples:
- hover highlights
- click/press reactions
- color changes for state
- subtle motion or scale pulses

goal:
- understand why feedback matters
- use color / scale / motion to show state
- keep feedback responsive and readable
